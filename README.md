# Creative Brief - goodreadsbookshelf
## Client: Goodreads
## Project Name:  Goodreads “My Books” Redesign

## Objective:
The objective of the Goodreads "My Books" Redesign is to recreate a more user-friendly, intuitive, and modern “bookshelf” page where Goodreads users can easily view, browse, review archive and share books they love on-line.

## Client Mission Statement:
Goodreads is the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. Goodreads launched in January 2007.

## Target Audience:

- **Brand Target**:     Goodreads has 55million members, it’s free so it’s accessible to all income levels, anyone on facebook or social media, and anyone who is old enough and educated enough to read books will be the target audience

- **Project Target**: Goodreads members and their friends who love to read and want to share and discover new books on-line

- **Audience Reaction**: Members will use Goodreads “my bookshelf” page as their primary source for archiving, finding, sharing and reviewing books they love.

## Competitive Analysis:
Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, Itunes – offer similar customizable “libraries” that allow users to share, review, and discover products. These services also suggest new products and have a personalized element to the design
